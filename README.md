This repository contains the full Java source code and data for a project that implements and optimizes an AI for the board game **Murus Gallicus**. The work is based on research that uses **Genetic Algorithms (GAs)** to evolve the strongest possible AI player for the game.

## About the Game

[Murus Gallicus](https://sites.google.com/site/theowlsnest02/home/murus-gallicus) is a two-player abstract strategy game designed by Phil Leduc. The goal is to either reach the opponent's home row or leave the opponent with no legal moves. The game is played on an 8x7 board.

## ðŸŽ® About the Project

This Java application allows for:

- ðŸ‘¤ Two-player matches on the same device
- ðŸ¤– Human vs Bot matches
- ðŸ¤– Bot vs Bot simulations

## How Genetic Algorithm is Used

The Caesar AI's behavior is encoded in a chromosome (weights for heuristics and decision-making parameters).

## Features

- Full implementation of Murus Gallicus
- Console-based game play between human and/or AI players
- Adjustable match duration (play time per player)

## Setup & Requirements

- Java 8 or later
- No external libraries required

## Citation and Academic Use

This code was developed as part of a bachelor thesis and research paper on applying genetic algorithms to optimize board game AI. It is intended for both educational and experimental use.
